# Static Portfolio Website with Tech Hacker Aesthetic

This project is a static HTML/CSS/JS conversion of a React-based portfolio website, redesigned with a "tech hacker" aesthetic while maintaining professional appeal.

## Conversion Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Tech Hacker Aesthetic**
   - Implemented a dark color scheme with deep blacks and dark blues
   - Added neon green/cyan accents for interactive elements
   - Incorporated terminal-like elements (command prompts, typing animations)
   - Used monospace fonts (JetBrains Mono) for headings and code-like elements
   - Added subtle glitch and tech-inspired animations

2. **Structural Improvements**
   - Converted all React components to semantic HTML5
   - Implemented a mobile-first responsive design
   - Optimized DOM structure for performance
   - Organized CSS with logical grouping of related styles

3. **Interactive Elements**
   - Added subtle animations for state changes (hover effects, focus states)
   - Implemented terminal-inspired loading screen
   - Added command-line prompts for section headers
   - Created micro-interactions like typing effects and glitch animations

4. **Accessibility Enhancements**
   - Ensured proper contrast ratios for readability
   - Added ARIA attributes where appropriate
   - Implemented proper focus states for interactive elements
   - Used semantic HTML elements

- SVG used for graphics where possible
- No external dependencies except for Lucide icons
